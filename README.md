# Useful snippets for web development
I created this application to facilitate and speed up the workflow.

I've put together various snippets of code that I use often or even every day, organized them compactly, sorted them into categories, and made them easy to find.

This solution turned out to be quite effective, and my colleagues were also grateful to me when I shared this tool with them :)

To implement this application, I used HTML, CSS and Javascript. The UI was also developed by myself.
